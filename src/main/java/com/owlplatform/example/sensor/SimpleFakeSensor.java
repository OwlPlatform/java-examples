 * A simple class demonstrating how to write a Java-based sensor component by

 * This class makes use of the {@link SensorAggregatorInterface} in the simplest
 * way possible - by polling its state and treating it strictly as a member.
 * However, the {@code SensorAggregatorInterface} supports the Observable
 * pattern, and registering as a {@link ConnectionListener} allows more
 * efficient interaction at the cost of greater complexity.
